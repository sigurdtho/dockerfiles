# TensorFlow

To build the default TensorFlow image without GPU-support, run something like
``` console
$Â docker build -t tensorflow:cpu .
```

To enable GPU-support, set the `$BASE_IMAGE` build argument to any CUDA image
that is known to work with the latest version of TensorFlow; for example
``` console
$ docker build -t tensorflow:gpu --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=nvidia/cuda:8.0-cudnn6-devel .
```
